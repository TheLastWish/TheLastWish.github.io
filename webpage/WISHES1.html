When i started writing this message i tought of write about you in crisp nd short after few seconds my brain replies <br>
<b>BRAIN :" oyeeeee idiot😠 it's impossible to describe about her in short "</b> <br>
Mean while my heart said that<br>
<b>HEART:" oyee mahesh write how much ever u want that LUSU🐣 don't have a choice other than reading this whole message🤭🤭" </b><br>

I don't know how we both become BESTIEEES because i am short tempered i won't be regular to classes i am too lazy, irresponsible ect......u r exactly opposite to it ( ego is common character between both of us😂) .....may be " to become best friends common characters won't be needed it's something else right😍?? and you r tooooo lucky too have me as ur best friend 🙊🙊🤣🥳🥳🤭🤭 <br>
 
To describe the bond in our friendship 🐥🐋we r not too expressive with each other ......but if we went through our old conversation where we fought with each other 🐣🤛🏼and observes why we fought and how we solved it that will clear shows how much we two cares each other❤❤ ofcourse both of us r egoistic persons so naveen or sandy or someone will be there in between so help 😂😂 <br>

Thank god 😇that I don't have a habit of writing dairy in my clg life  ..if it is the case half of my book was filled with you only😍 <br>

Many more happy returns of the day makki 🐥😍<br>

With love<br>

								<p class="text-right"> Everybody wants a twin,but only some cool kids get one.Back in the good old days, faculties used to call us doppelgangers.Not for any physical resemblance,but for we stayed together all the time right from waking up ,getting ready to class, having food,sitting together during class hrs ,going back to hostel,visiting faculty room,restroom.. what not?
             U have been there for me n i have been there fr u all the time, until few misunderstandings happened.Things changed.I was in despair at the misunderstanding that had occurred between us.It took more than a year for us to get back together.But , i couldn't feel the closeness we had in initial yrs of our engineering.
Longing for us to become  the same old twin girls!!❤️ <br>
happy birthday makki ma😍<br>
  With love<br>

								<p class="text-right"> I always called u by SISTER rather than ur real name nd sometimes even have forgetten ur name 😂.....in case if i really did have an own sister also i might not have called her SISTER these many times .....<br>

After u came to into my life a small space in my life was filled.... initially i didn't recognise it but after days passed by i realised that i got a sister for life <br>
That MI phone knows how many times u shouted at me bcoz i called u those many times 😂 even then i will call u as i don't have any other sister than you🤩<br>
U r <b>too innocent, caring, cunning, talented, sweet and many more.....</b> be like this forever...don evr change <br>

A sincere smile,love,care,anger,fun,and what not......
