I know we met through a very important person to both of us, and eventually you became my sister! Most of our conversations are small, we used to talk about a lot of things. We don't even talk that often. Some of our conversations used to be about that important person through whom we met. I know that your relationship with that person is not in a good place. But I want you to know no matter what happens you will always be my sister, You will always be a special person in my Life and remember that if you ever need to talk about anything in your life, just remember that you have a brother who doesn't talk much but is definitely a <b>Good listener!</b><br>

This birthday you are in a new place, new world with new people in the corporate world.All I have to say to my sister on her birthday is  to Stay Strong and always keep your chin up. Never lose your confidence. Make good friends who care for you and want what's best for you. I know we have a lot in common, So I am giving you this advice to Live your life according to your values, never compromise your values to make sure everyone around you are happy. Whatever you do in life you can't keep everyone happy So live your life how you wish! <br>
I have said this before that you are the sister I wish i had.<br>
Hope you have a great year and live this year the way you like!!!! <br>

HAPPY BIRTHDAY MAHITHA!!<br>

<b>P.S. I know for a fact that we are both shy people So I am writing this again, Always Remember you have a  Big brother! Never ever hesitate to call me when you need someone to talk to.</b><br>

- Your big brother! <br></p>
