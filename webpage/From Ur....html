I know we met through a very important person to both of us, and eventually you became my sister! Most of our conversations are small, we used to talk about a lot of things. We don't even talk that often. Some of our conversations used to be about that important person through whom we met. I know that your relationship with that person is not in a good place. But I want you to know no matter what happens you will always be my sister, You will always be a special person in my Life and remember that if you ever need to talk about anything in your life, just remember that you have a brother who doesn't talk much but is definitely a <b>Good listener!</b><br>

								<p>Hey Mahitha!!.... What's up....Hope ur life's going smooth and purposeful without being stymied with any friction. I am pretty sure that ur "After College life" is opening new treasures of lessons and experiences and teaching u the nuances of the competitive and dynamic world.<br>

To make ur day more special, I wud like to dive deep into the past and extract a mutual memory of ours during college days which made me realize of what metal Mahitha is really made of!!!!<br>


It was the first week of August 2017 , when we are preparing tightly for gokulashtami celebrations . There was a quiz competition and we happened to contest it as a team. And if I am not wrong we were one of the six teams that made to the finals . I remember , before we took that test...u were morally low about ur capabilities and I had to tell u that we are participating this jus for the sake of participation scores. But as the test rolled on , u were damn involved and helped me in answering many questions....

I still remember a question that u answered which was not even guessed by many other counterparts..

<b><i><q>"Where is NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NUTRITION located??"</q></i></b>

In a split of second..u answered it as Hyderabad...
Then I asked u how u came across it??
U were like " Anna..we have a subject in nutrition ... Our mam happened to tell about this institute in the class"...


EVEN TODAY WHENEVER I COME ACROSS NEWS OR STUDY ABOUT NUTRITION...IF I COME ACROSS "NAT INS OF NUT"... THE FIRST PERSON THAT POPS UP IN MY MIND IS U


Then eventually..I was hospitalized...but u participated all alone in the finals along with other teams which had pairs....And u grabbed second prize to the chagrin of many

So from being aspirationally low to going on to score a second prize fighting all alone ...what made it possible for Mahitha??

1) Beating ur own blues and sitting for the competition by sporting a positive spirit<br>
2) Memorising the lessons taught in the class and replicating it in the tensed atmosphere<br>
3) Unfallen determination even in the absence of teammate and fighting till the last mile<br>

<b><i>Mahitha is made of virtual metal called
 <q>"FORTITUDE"</q> </i></b>
 So what all I want to say is...<b><i><q>"Never loose ur essence...U r here to fight for urself"</q></i></b>...The FORTITUDE that u displayed in many instances shud be scaled up even on future...

U know what..the biggest enemy to ur existence is nothing but <b><i><q>"Low aspiration and Peer pressure"</q></i></b>

So for this bday...I would like to boost u up with the words of my favourite personality Martin Luther King...

<b><i><q>" Always believe that ur existence has a worth..never let anybody feel that u are nobody..Have a deep belief in ur own somebodiness...</q></i></b><br>

If u can't be a tree , be a bush..<br>
If u can't be an highway, be a trail...<br>
If u can't be a sun, be a star..<br>

It's not about the size or success... it's about being the best of whatever u are<br>

So...if u can't fly..U run<br>
If u can't run...u walk<br>
If u can't walk..U crawl...but by any means keep moving..."<br>

The only measure and metric for success in life is " The pride that gets instilled in ur parents by u which makes them sleep happily"<br>

With regards,<br>
Sri Pranav Maliye.....EEE (2014-18) </p>

								<p class="text-right">Hi Mahitha.I hope everything be doing great in your life and wish you a happy birthday üéâüéâüéÇ.<br>
The real art of conversation is not only to say the right thing at the right time, but also to leave unsaid the usual thing  at the tempting moments. Here comes that moment "Wish you Happy Birthday Mahitha" .I would like to make this day with a lot of memories which made our bond.<br>
There was one thing which stuck in my mind and make myself realise, it comes out when your name is heard i.e,"Character" because in a lots of incidents and moments.(I don't want to mention it here).
Because you will be more concerned with your character than your reputation because your character is what you really are .. 
The other thing is that Rakhi .It's an unforgettable memory in my life.<br>

<b><i>Mahitha, I hope you will maintain same kind of attitude and Character.Put on smile along with thatüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÑü§©ü•≥ü•≥</i></b><br>

Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life.. think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success.

So keep Rocking always, be Happy n active, don't give any room for sadness, don't step back for failures, get up go strike back hard next time!üéØ<br>

On this special day, Wanted to say you few things which will help you to grow and be a better person each day in the challenging life ahead...üí™üèª<br>

<b>Be practical and learn to handle things in a better way, when they don't happen the way you want to. You should always be confident about your choices and learn to be independent because in the end, you should be the one taking care of yourself.</b><br> 

Always work with a desired goal but never think too much about the end result...The more you think, the greater you fear - which is not good... Be sincere at work, stick to the process and never loose the focus in between.... You will always get a good result.<br>

In the whole life, remember that you will always end up in a place for some reason...So grab that chance and make the most use of the opportunities you get..<br>

Wishing you all the very best and wonderful years ahead.Make your parents proud and always Keep smiling üòÑü•≥ü•≥<br>
